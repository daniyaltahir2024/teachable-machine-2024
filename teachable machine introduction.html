<h1> 3."How does a teaching machine work?</h1>
    <p>In general, they all work on the same method, which is to present a question, have the user indicate the answer, and then provide the user with the correct answer. Some machines may be extremely simple, such as test sheets or books so programmed that the student locates the answers to the questions later." </H1>
